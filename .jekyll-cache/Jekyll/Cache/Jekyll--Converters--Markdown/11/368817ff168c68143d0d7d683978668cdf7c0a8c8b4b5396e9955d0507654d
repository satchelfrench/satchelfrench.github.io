Friction is a fundamental feature of our universe, dictating how much work is required to move an object in a given direction.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m interested in the idea of behavioral friction; how easy or difficult it is to fall into a given behavior.</p>

\[F = \mu m a\]

<ul>
  <li><strong>Friction has three components:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>\(m\) is the mass of behavior, in other words â€“ how large is the task?</li>
      <li>\(a\) is the acceleration, or how much momentum and work are you putting into this?</li>
      <li>\(\mu\) is the coefficient of friction, which quantifies how your environment is impacting the amount of friction.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Vices typically have very low friction, (very low \(\mu\), small \(m\) and can have lots of acceleration \(a\)).</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>i.e. Watching Television
	- small \(\mu\): television remote is within reach, one button press from away
	- small \(m\): Itâ€™s not some large task, its sitting down watching tv
	- large \(a\): If youâ€™ve built the habit of bingeing shows, or watching sports, you have a lot of momentum going into this.</li>
      <li>Can apply to things like: Video games, eating snacks from the fridge.</li>
      <li><em>In other words, the force required to accelerate the behaviour is very small and thus easy.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Aspirations typically have very high friction (high \(\mu\), large \(m\) and low \(a\))</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>i.e. Run a marathon
        <ul>
          <li>large \(\mu\), what trigger are there to encourage you to run when youâ€™re at home? (\(\mu\) is large by default)</li>
          <li>large \(m\) â€“ the task is too large to move in one move (needs to be smaller)</li>
          <li>small \(a\) â€“â€“ if youâ€™re already not running often, there isnâ€™t much wind at your back, and it requires a fair bit of work to start</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Friction can however be used to anyoneâ€™s advantage</strong>, you simply want to <strong>add friction</strong> to <strong>undesirable behaviors</strong> and <strong>reduce friction</strong> between <strong>desired behaviors</strong>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>i.e. Reducing Television Watch Time
        <ul>
          <li>increase \(\mu\), move the TV remote to a distance corner of your home, unplug the television, get a cabinet to cover it and remove the trigger.</li>
          <li>increase \(m\), make watching TV a larger task â€“ for example you have to watch 1 hour of lecture before you allow yourself any television.</li>
          <li>reduce \(a\), try to quit watching TV for one week, avoid binge-ing content. This will slow your momentum.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>i.e. Start Running a Marathon
        <ul>
          <li>increase \(\mu\), put your running shoes and exercise clothes by the front door as a trigger. Add running posters or posted notes around the house to remind yourself</li>
          <li>reduce \(m\), a marathon is a big goal, maybe start with something approachable like 10 minutes of running at a comfortable pace for a week.</li>
          <li>increase \(a\) â€“ create momentum, going a running club, create accountability, try to make it a habit.
<br />
<br />
I think this is a fun way to think about how one might go about changing a behaviour, just remember â€” itâ€™s basic physics.</li>
