Friction is a fundamental feature of our universe, dictating how much work is required to move an object in a given direction.

I'm interested in the idea of behavioral friction; how easy or difficult it is to fall into a given behavior.

$$F = \mu m a$$

**Friction has three components:**

1. $$m$$ is the mass of behavior, in other words – how large is the task?
2. $$a$$ is the acceleration, or how much momentum and work are you putting into this?
3. $$\mu$$ is the coefficient of friction, which quantifies how your environment is impacting the amount of friction.

**Vices typically have very low friction, (very low $$\mu$$, small $$m$$ and can have lots of acceleration $$a$$).**
- i.e. Watching Television
  	- small $$\mu$$: television remote is within reach, one button press from away
  	- small $$m$$: It's not some large task, its sitting down watching tv
  	- large $$a$$: If you've built the habit of bingeing shows, or watching sports, you have a lot of momentum going into this.
- Can apply to things like: Video games, eating snacks from the fridge.
- *In other words, the force required to accelerate the behaviour is very small and thus easy.*


**Aspirations typically have very high friction (high $$\mu$$, large $$m$$ and low $$a$$)**
- i.e. Run a marathon
	- large $$\mu$$, what trigger are there to encourage you to run when you're at home? ($$\mu$$ is large by default)
	- large $$m$$ – the task is too large to move in one move (needs to be smaller)
	- small $$a$$ –– if you're already not running often, there isn't much wind at your back, and it requires a fair bit of work to start

**Friction can however be used to anyone's advantage**, you simply want to **add friction** to **undesirable behaviors** and **reduce friction** between **desired behaviors**.

- i.e. Reducing Television Watch Time
	- increase $$\mu$$, move the TV remote to a distance corner of your home, unplug the television, get a cabinet to cover it and remove the trigger.
	- increase $$m$$, make watching TV a larger task – for example you have to watch 1 hour of lecture before you allow yourself any television. 
	- reduce $$a$$, try to quit watching TV for one week, avoid binge-ing content. This will slow your momentum.

- i.e. Start Running a Marathon
	- increase $$\mu$$, put your running shoes and exercise clothes by the front door as a trigger. Add running posters or posted notes around the house to remind yourself
	- reduce $$m$$, a marathon is a big goal, maybe start with something approachable like 10 minutes of running at a comfortable pace for a week.
	- increase $$a$$ – create momentum, going a running club, create accountability, try to make it a habit.

I think this is a fun way to think about how one might go about changing a behaviour, just remember — it's basic physics.
